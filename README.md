# -A-Study-On-Survival-Analysis-and-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Model-

Introduction

 Customer survival and churn is a term that refers to the rate at which customers stay and leave the business in future. Churn could be due to various factors, including switching to a competitor, or cancelling their subscription because of poor customer service. Long-term relationships with customers are more effective than trying to attract new customers.
The telecommunications industry across the world is becoming one of the major sectors. Because of the globalization and developments of tele-com industry and tremendously increased the number of operators in the market that escalates the competition. The customer churn prediction is one of the challenging problems in the tele-com industry. The capability to predict customer survival and churn has significantly increased because of advancement in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
The main aim of the study is to explore the customer churn prediction in telecom using in machine learning models. Customers retain in a telecom industry has already become a nightmare as a result of increased competitive services. The major contribution of the current study is to present a model of churn prediction that helps telecom companies to find users who are more intending to churn. Machine learning can possibly be the sort of tools which could help telecom companies in churn prediction model. To create a churn prediction machine learning model telecom data is collected from Kaggle and cleaning data and creating a machine learning algorithm to predict the churn.

Objectives 
•	To explore the customer survival analysis and churn prediction in telecom dataset using machine learning models.
•	To investigate the impact of customer churn in tele-com industry.
•	The purpose of this research is to develop and design an effective and efficient machine learning model for customer churn prediction in tele-com industry.
